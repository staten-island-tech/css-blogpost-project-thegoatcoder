        <h2>A HANS device (head and neck support device) is a type of head restraint, a safety device in motorsports.
            Head restraints are mandatory when competing with most major motorsports sanctioning bodies. They reduce the
            likelihood of head or neck injuries, including the often fatal basilar skull fracture, in the event of a
            crash. There are many such devices on the market today, but the HANS is the original and the most common.

                properties, is clothing such as overalls worn in various forms of auto racing by racing drivers, crew
                members who work on the vehicles during races, track safety workers or marshals, and in some series
                commentators at the event. </h2>
